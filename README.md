light sign designed and build by Professor Paillet Eric of the University of Antwerp. The SmartTrafficLight is an
3D-printed traffic light sign with two lights: Red and Green. The traffic lights are controlled with a Raspberri Pi
for processing. The SmartTrafficLights are used to control the traffic flow in the SmartCity.
